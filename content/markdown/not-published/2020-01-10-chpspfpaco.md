*Cats*, 2019. The film opens with a creepy CGI-cat-person hybrid crawling into view. After getting over the initial shock of the appearance of the cast, I begin to actually enjoy the visual spectacle of the film. Lithe cat-people dancing across the screen. I almost wish I was seeing this on stage just so I could enjoy the choreography in person; it’s that good.

After the first few group songs, the film moves to the first song about an individual character, *The Gumbie Cat*. The cat, Jennyanydots, is fat. I cringe. I see what’s coming. Played by renowned fat comedian, Rebel Wilson, the cat trips, stumbles, gets hit in the face by things, and generally acts kind of dumb. Later in the song, she gleefully eats cockroaches in front of the other, disgusted, cats. She is the only fat female cast member. In the following song, another fat cat, Bustopher Jones played by James Corden, gets hit in the crotch while attempting to jump into a pile of trash that he wants to eat. Even though I am not fat myself, I feel the way I do after watching a particularly racist scene in an old film; like I want to turn to someone and say, “I promise I don’t think of you that way.”

The songs themselves are faithful to the Broadway original. Jennyanydots is canonically a fat housecat. Bustopher Jones’s song is actually about how much he loves to eat and get fat. But getting hit in the face with a frying pan? Falling onto his crotch? That was a directorial choice. None of the other cats have any slapstick comedy in their scenes. I wish we could live in a world where the entire joke of a slapstick routine wasn’t “the lady is clumsy and stupid because she is fat”.

One may argue that the way Jennyanydots is portrayed in the film is harmless. She’s fat and lazy, that’s her character! Bustopher Jones’s entire character is based on him being fat! However, this argument is missing the point. Every single film that portrays fat people as clumsy and oafish contributes to the narrative that fat people are worth less, period. If Hollywood can move in the direction of not always portraying black people as drug dealers, Indian people as doctors and cab drivers, and Asian people as sexless math nerds, then they can also move in the direction of portraying fat people as, well, people.

This phenomenon is not universal in media; television has been savvy to this for years. Shows like *Mike and Molly*, *My Mad Fat Diary*, and even *Orange is the New Black* have all steered clear of putting their plus-sized leading characters in idiotic slapstick routines. Additionally, here are some of my favourite instances on television where fat people are actually portrayed in a positive light:

In *Gilmore Girls*, Melissa McCarthy’s character, Sookie, is a delight to watch. Yes, she is a fat chef, which plays to a certain stereotype, but her love of food is portrayed as charming creativity and passion rather than gluttony. When she and her produce distributor fall in love over a mutual admiration for quality ingredients (#relatable), the relationship is portrayed as multifaceted and loving.

Though he is a problematic figure these days, Louis CK’s show *Louie* features one of my favourite television portrayals of the struggles of fat women dating in the episode “So Did The Fat Lady” (2014). In the last scene, Sarah Baker delivers a monologue that is so painfully honest, refreshing, and real, that it will stay with me forever.

In *Parks and Recreation*, Donna Meagle, played by Retta, is awesome. In the first season, her character does not have a lot of dimension. But by the end of the show’s run, Donna is a full-fledged powerhouse of funny. From her “treat yo’self!” skits with Aziz Ansari to her ability to convey the way the entire cast is feeling by simply looking at the camera, Retta proves that fat women can do more in comedy than just eat and act clumsy.

The way that media is changing to represent more people is wonderful, but Hollywood seems dreadfully behind the times. Look, I’m not asking that we put more fat people in leading roles in movies, though we should. I’m not asking that we portray fat women as desirable, graceful, multifaceted individuals, though we absolutely should. I’m just begging Hollywood to please, please, stop putting fat people on screen just to show them eating and getting hit in the face with a pie.
